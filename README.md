# Spotify-Streamer
This project has been developed as part of Udacity's Nanodegree in Android development.
The app is a Spotify streamer. The user is able to search for an artist, 
get his 10 top tracks and play a preview of them.
The app implements a full screen ui player, a reduced one (when full player is closed) and
media control players as a notification in the lockscreen.
